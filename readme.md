# Fun with recursion
Just a small project to mess around with HTML canvas and JavaScript

# Link to gh pages
https://gh05ts.github.io/Recursion-Fractals

## To do
* Add sliders for user control
* Add random colors on/ off
* Add realistic tree mode (make a wrapper for first recursive call with thicker and longer trunk)
* Add snowflakes?
